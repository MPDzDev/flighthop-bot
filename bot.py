FlightHop bot entry point.

This script defines the Telegram bot handlers for the FlightHop game. It uses
python-telegram-bot to handle commands, guesses, and daily progression.

Note: This is a placeholder implementation. You need to implement the actual
bot logic, including loading routes from data/routes.json, tracking per-group
state in data/state.json, and responding to user guesses.
