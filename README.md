# flighthop-bot
A Telegram bot game for learning airport codes and geography through real-world flight routes.

This repository contains a minimal proof-of-concept implementation using [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/). Run `telegram_bot.py` and point a Telegram bot token at it to play the daily challenge in a group chat.
